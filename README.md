## Recipe Chrome Extension
Project for McHacks X
Date: January 28-29, 2022

## Brief Introduction to the Product
Rad Kitchen is a Google Chrome extension, the ultimate tool for creating delicious recipes with the ingredients you already have on hand. This Chrome Extension is easy to install and is connected to Radish's ingredient website. By surfing and saving ingredients of interests from the Radish website, the user can store them in your personal ingredient library. The extension will then generate a recipe based on the ingredients you have saved and provide you with a list of recipes that you can make with the ingredients you already have. You can also search for recipes based on specific dietary restrictions or cuisine type. 

## How to Download
Download or clone this repository in order to extend the recipe-chrome-extension.

In addition, you will need individual API keys for:
- Cohere NLP
- OpenAI
- Twilio
These can be found on the websites. By replacing the .env file with these API keys, the program will be able to work.

The last thing to do is to go to Chrome and go to developer mode, and upload the extensions folder of this repo. This will upload it to the Chrome extension with all the needed dependencies.
